# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Mistral AI. We appreciate your time and effort!

## Official docs

If you are interested in contributing to our [official docs](docs.mistral.ai), please submit a PR at [https://github.com/mistralai/platform-docs-public](https://github.com/mistralai/platform-docs-public). 

Note: Please follow the following steps to make sure your changes can be deployed successfully.

### Set up 

You will need to install `pnpm` and `node` first. For example, if you are using Mac. You can install [Homebrew](brew.sh) and then install `pnpm` and `node`:
```
brew install pnpm
brew install node
```

### Install project dependencies 

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. Make sure everything compiles successfully and the local browser accurately reflects your intended changes. 

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
