# Platform

We provide chat generation endpoints for both our [open-weight models](../models.md) and our optimized models. 
Our endpoints can be used with our [client packages](../client) or accessed directly through our [API](../../api).
See our [endpoints page](../endpoints) for a detailed description of endpoints performance. We detail how to moderate
our endpoints in [guardrailing](../guardrailing), and their [prices](../pricing).
